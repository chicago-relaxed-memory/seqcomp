\citet{DBLP:conf/esop/PaviottiCPWOB20} use step-indexing to account for
loops; we expect that the same approach could be applied here.

% We have presented the first model of relaxed memory that treats sequential
% composition as a first-class citizen. The model builds directly on \jjr{}.

% For sequential composition, parallel composition and the conditional, we
% believe that the definition is \emph{natural}, even \emph{canonical}.
% For stores and loads, instead, the definition in \reffig{fig:no-addr} is a
% Frankenstein's monster of features.  This complexity is \emph{essential},
% however, not just an accident of our poor choices.  Relaxed memory models must
% please many audiences: compiler writers want one thing, hardware designers
% another, and programmers yet another still.  The result is inevitably full of
% compromise.

% Given that \emph{complexity} cannot be eliminated from relaxed memory models,
% the best one can do is attempt to understand its causes.  We have broken the
% problem into seven manageable pieces, discussed throughout
% \textsection\ref{sec:q}--\ref{sec:complications}.  \refdef{def:pomsets-arm}
% summarizes all the features necessary for efficient implementation on
% \armeight{}.  We discuss address calculation, read-modify-write operations
% and fences in the appendix.

% {Logic} is the thread that sews these features together.

% %A unique feature of our model is the centrality of logic: 

% % study each feature in isolation, as a small delta to the base definition
% % given in \textsection\ref{sec:model}.
% % In we studied eight such
% % features.

% % one wants all the features that it embodies.  By breaking the definition into
% % its constituent parts, we have shown how each of eight
