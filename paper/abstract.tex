% This paper presents the first compositional definition of sequential
% composition that applies to a relaxed memory model weak enough to allow
% efficient implementation on Arm.  We extend the denotational model of pomsets
% with preconditions with predicate transformers. Previous work has shown that
% pomsets with preconditions are a model of concurrent composition, and that
% predicate transformers are a model of sequential composition.  This paper
% show how they can be combined.

% Program logics and semantics tell us that in order to derive
% \begin{math}
%   ((S_1\SEMI S_2), \sigma_0) \Downarrow \sigma_2,
% \end{math}
% we derive 
% \begin{math}
%   (S_1, \sigma_0) \Downarrow \sigma_1
% \end{math}
% and then
% \begin{math}
%   (S_2, \sigma_1) \Downarrow \sigma_2.
% \end{math}
Program logics and semantics tell us that when executing $(S_1; S_2)$ starting in state $s_0$,
we execute $S_1$ in $s_0$ to arrive at $s_1$, then execute $S_2$ in $s_1$ to
arrive at the final state $s_2$.  This is, of course, an abstraction.  Processors
execute instructions out of order, due to pipelines and caches, and compilers
reorder programs even more dramatically.  All of this reordering is meant to
be unobservable in single-threaded code, but is observable in multi-threaded code.
A formal attempt to understand the resulting mess is known
as a ``relaxed memory model.''  The relaxed memory models that have been
proposed to date either fail to address sequential composition directly, or overly
restrict processors and compilers.

To support sequential composition while targeting modern hardware, we propose
using preconditions and families of predicate transformers.  When composing
$(S_1;S_2)$, the predicate transformers used to validate the preconditions of
events in $S_2$ are chosen based on the semantic dependencies from events in
$S_1$ to events in $S_2$.  We apply this approach to two existing memory
models: ``Modular Relaxed Dependencies'' for C11 and ``Pomsets with
Preconditions.''
